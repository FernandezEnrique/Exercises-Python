# Exercises with Python

Here you will find a list of Python Exercises to practice.

# 00 - Quick Start

- 01 -> Store "Hello World!" in a var and print it
- 02 -> Ask the user for their name and print `Hello <Name>`
- 03 -> Ask for 2 numbers and add them up
- 04 -> Ask for hours worked and hourly rate and print how much charged
- 05 -> Ask for 2 numbers (m and n), it will print quotient and remainder


# 03 - Loops

        number = 5
        
        1
        3 1
        5 3 1
        7 5 3 1
        9 7 5 3 1 

# 06 - Functions

- 01 -> Define a function max() that takes 2 numbers and returns max. 
(Python already has a max() function though)
- 02 -> Define a function max_of_three() that takes 3 numbers
and return the larguest one
- 03 -> Define a function that takes a char and returns True
if it is a vowel and False if it is not
- 04 -> Define a function addition() and multip() that adds up 
and multiplies all the number in a given list. 
Ex. sum([1,2,3,4]) returns 10 and multip([1,2,3,4]) returns 24
- 05 -> Define a function that reverses words. Example: "hello" is "olleh"
- 06 -> Define a function that checks if a string is a palindrome. 
Example: "anna" is a palindrome but "car" is not
